This library written in Typescript is a wrapper based on [pdfmake](http://pdfmake.org) to generate PDF documents in an easy and readable way.

---

> [!NOTE]
> while the upstream project is no longer maintained, the package that it is designed to work with is still active. compared to `pdfmake@0.1.x`, `pdfmake@0.2.x` does change some of it's own internal dependencies, but it has no breaking changes in it's own API.
>
> this fork simply allows `pdfmake-wrapper` to be used with `pdfmake@0.2.x`, without needing to jump through NPM argument hoops.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This library is no longer maintained, use pdfmake instead.

Go to the new documentation website **[pdfmakewrapper.org](https://pdfmakewrapper.org)**. You can check pdf examples from the original pdfmake repository [here](https://github.com/bpampuch/pdfmake/blob/master/examples/).
